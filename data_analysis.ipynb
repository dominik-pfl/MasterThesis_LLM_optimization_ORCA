       "1  An attacker uses techniques and methods to bypass physical security measures of a building or facility. Physical locks may range from traditional lock and key mechanisms, cable locks used to secure laptops or servers, locks on server cases, or other such devices. Techniques such as lock bumping, lock forcing via snap guns, or lock picking can be employed to bypass those locks and gain access to the facilities or devices they protect, although stealth, evidence of tampering, and the integrity of the lock following an attack, are considerations that may determine the method employed. Physical locks are limited by the complexity of the locking mechanism. While some locks may offer protections such as shock resistant foam to prevent bumping or lock forcing methods, many commonly employed locks offer no such countermeasures.   \n",

       "0  A Threat with the title An attacker exploits insecure designs or lack of adaption in O-RAN components and the description Unauthenticated/unauthorized access to O-RAN components could possibly be achieved via the different O-RAN interfaces, depending upon the design of the hardware-software O-RAN system and how different functions are segregated within the O-RAN system. \\nO-RAN components might be vulnerable if: \\n• Outdated component from the lack of update or patch management,\\n• Poorly design architecture,\\n• Missing appropriate security hardening,\\n• Unnecessary or insecure function/protocol/component.\\nAn attacker could, in such case, either inject malwares and/or manipulate existing software, harm the O-RAN components, create a performance issue by manipulation of parameters, or reconfigure the O-RAN components and disable the security features with the purpose of eavesdropping or wiretapping on various CUS & M planes, reaching northbound systems, attack broader network to cause denial-of-service, steal unprotected private keys, certificates, hash values, or other type of breaches.\\nIn addition, O-RAN components could be software providing network functions, so they are likely to be vulnerable to software flaws: it could be possible to bypass firewall restrictions or to take advantage of a buffer overflow to execute arbitrary commands, etc.   \n",

These interfaces may not be secured to industry best practices.\\nO-RAN components might be vulnerable if: \\n• Improper or missing authentication and authorization processes,\\n• Improper or missing ciphering and integrity checks of sensitive data exchanged over O-RAN interfaces,\\n• Improper or missing replay protection of sensitive data exchanged over O-RAN interfaces,\\n• Improper prevention of key reuse,\\n• Improper implementation,\\n• Improperly validate inputs, respond to error conditions in both the submitted data as well as out of sequence protocol steps.\\nAn attacker could, in such case, cause denial-of-service, data tampering or information disclosure, etc.\\nNOTE: O-RAN interfaces allow use of TLS or SSH. Industry best practices mandate the use of TLS (v1.2 or higher) or SSH certificate-based authentication. An implementation that implements TLS version lower than 1.2 or a SSH password authentication, may become the key source of vulnerability that a malicious code will exploit to compromise the O-RAN system.   \n",

Email software has become increasingly sophisticated and feature-rich. In addition, email applications are ubiquitous and connected directly to the Web making them ideal targets to launch and propagate attacks. As the user demand for new functionality in email applications grows, they become more like browsers with complex rendering and plug in routines. As more email functionality is included and abstracted from the user, this creates opportunities for attackers. Virtually all email applications do not list email header information by default, however the email header contains valuable attacker vectors for the attacker to exploit particularly if the behavior of the email client application is known.

The description of this CAPEC is: An attacker sends random, malformed, or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash..

Let me start by understanding what each part means.\\n\\nThe threat is about a malicious function or application monitoring messaging across the A1 interface and being able to access it for a MiTM (multi-threat) attack to read policies. So, the main elements here are:\\n\\n1. Malicious function or application\\n2. Monitoring messaging across A1 interface\\n3. Access to messaging data\\n4. Potential threat through a multi-threat attack\\n\\nNow, CAPEC stands for Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification. Each CAPEC ID has specific categories that define different types of threats. I remember that the main categories are:\\n\\n- **C** - Cybersecurity (e.g., access control)\\n- **M** - Misinformation/Spam/Malware\\n- **T** - Threats/Trojan attacks\\n- **A** - Attack vectors\\n\\nSo, let\\'s break down each part of the threat and see which CAPEC category it falls into.\\n\\n1. **Malicious function or application**: This is definitely related to cybersecurity because it involves malicious software that can cause harm.\\n2. **Monitoring messaging across A1 interface**: This suggests that the system is tracking or intercepting communications, which ties into access control mechanisms.\\n3. **Access to messaging data**: If an attacker can read policies from this data, they might be able to manipulate or spread information, which relates to misinformation or spam.\\n\\nNow, looking at each CAPEC category:\\n\\n- **C (Cybersecurity)**: This is relevant because the threat involves monitoring and accessing sensitive data. The malicious function could be using access control measures.\\n  \\n- **M (Misinformation/Spam/Malware)**: While the threat involves access to data, it\\'s more about the content being misused rather than spreading malware itself.\\n\\n- **T (Threats/Trojan attacks)**: This fits because the threat is a multi-threat scenario where an application can be used to spread information or manipulate policies.\\n\\nPutting this together, the most relevant CAPEC IDs would include both Cybersecurity and Threat categories. However, looking at the options provided earlier, I think the primary ones are:\\n\\n- **C (Cybersecurity)**\\n- **T (Threats/Trojan attacks)**\\n\\nBut wait, the initial response included C, M, T. Let me double-check that.\\n\\nWait, in the initial thought process, I considered that the threat involves access control and misinformation. So, Cybersecurity is definitely relevant because of the monitoring and access. Misinformation might be a secondary concern here, but it\\'s still part of the broader threat landscape.\\n\\nSo, considering all this, the most relevant CAPEC IDs would be **C (Cybersecurity)** and **T (Threats/Trojan attacks)**. The mention of misinformation is more about the content being manipulated rather than directly a threat category.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n  \"C\",\\n  \"T\"\\n]\\n```' thinking=None context=[151644, 22043, 279, 2701, 5899, 12126, 1447, 262, 330, 32, 52335, 448, 279, 2265, 8394, 9627, 729, 476, 3766, 36477, 29522, 3941, 362, 16, 3749, 323, 279, 4008, 15412, 5899, 12089, 646, 8722, 2615, 311, 279, 29522, 3941, 279, 362, 16, 3749, 369, 264, 20740, 22034, 3359, 311, 1349, 4842, 2217, 262, 39565, 279, 1429, 9760, 9183, 10943, 28360, 369, 419, 5899, 3118, 389, 279, 4008, 315, 1817, 9183, 10943, 13, 9183, 10943, 13352, 369, 7718, 20790, 18834, 77125, 323, 54882, 382, 262, 1634, 458, 2550, 11, 3410, 264, 4718, 1334, 315, 9183, 10943, 28360, 429, 525, 1429, 9760, 311, 279, 5899, 7481, 13, 3155, 537, 2924, 894, 5107, 1467, 476, 40841, 11, 1101, 279, 4718, 1334, 13, 151645, 151648, 198, 32313, 11, 773, 358, 1184, 311, 7071, 700, 892, 9183, 10943, 28360, 3796, 311, 419, 5899, 12126, 13, 6771, 752, 1191, 553, 8660, 1128, 1817, 949, 3363, 382, 785, 5899, 374, 911, 264, 38170, 729, 476, 3766, 16558, 29522, 3941, 279, 362, 16, 3749, 323, 1660, 2952, 311, 2615, 432, 369, 264, 20740, 22034, 320, 26268, 55744, 8, 3359, 311, 1349, 10186, 13, 2055, 11, 279, 1887, 5424, 1588, 525, 1447, 16, 13, 8394, 9627, 729, 476, 3766, 198, 17, 13, 50703, 29522, 3941, 362, 16, 3749, 198, 18, 13, 9549, 311, 29522, 821, 198, 19, 13, 53957, 5899, 1526, 264, 7299, 55744, 3359, 271, 7039, 11, 9183, 10943, 13352, 369, 7718, 20790, 18834, 77125, 323, 54882, 13, 8886, 9183, 10943, 3034, 702, 3151, 11059, 429, 6979, 2155, 4494, 315, 17736, 13, 358, 6099, 429, 279, 1887, 11059, 525, 1447, 12, 3070, 34, 334, 481, 33611, 17039, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 2615, 2524, 340, 12, 3070, 44, 334, 481, 32559, 25069, 14, 6406, 309, 10270, 278, 1664, 198, 12, 3070, 51, 334, 481, 52335, 82, 16731, 299, 22838, 8776, 198, 12, 3070, 32, 334, 481, 20790, 22879, 271, 4416, 11, 1077, 594, 1438, 1495, 1817, 949, 315, 279, 5899, 323, 1490, 892, 9183, 10943, 5582, 432, 17066, 1119, 382, 16, 13, 3070, 29600, 9627, 729, 476, 3766, 95518, 1096, 374, 8491, 5435, 311, 61442, 1576, 432, 17601, 38170, 3162, 429, 646, 5240, 11428, 624, 17, 13, 3070, 98062, 29522, 3941, 362, 16, 3749, 95518, 1096, 13230, 429, 279, 1849, 374, 14849, 476, 28639, 287, 16893, 11, 892, 19818, 1119, 2615, 2524, 23783, 624, 18, 13, 3070, 6054, 311, 29522, 821, 95518, 1416, 458, 30710, 646, 1349, 10186, 504, 419, 821, 11, 807, 2578, 387, 2952, 311, 36635, 476, 8865, 1995, 11, 892, 35616, 311, 74059, 476, 25328, 382, 7039, 11, 3330, 518, 1817, 9183, 10943, 5582, 1447, 12, 3070, 34, 320, 56715, 652, 17039, 32295, 25, 1096, 374, 9760, 1576, 279, 5899, 17601, 16558, 323, 31788, 16216, 821, 13, 576, 38170, 729, 1410, 387, 1667, 2615, 2524, 10953, 624, 2303, 12, 3070, 44, 320, 83159, 25069, 14, 6406, 309, 10270, 278, 1664, 32295, 25, 5976, 279, 5899, 17601, 2615, 311, 821, 11, 432, 594, 803, 911, 279, 2213, 1660, 5786, 2591, 4751, 1091, 30035, 39731, 5086, 382, 12, 3070, 51, 320, 1001, 1222, 82, 16731, 299, 22838, 8776, 32295, 25, 1096, 18304, 1576, 279, 5899, 374, 264, 7299, 55744, 15048, 1380, 458, 3766, 646, 387, 1483, 311, 8865, 1995, 476, 36635, 10186, 382, 97904, 419, 3786, 11, 279, 1429, 9760, 9183, 10943, 28360, 1035, 2924, 2176, 33611, 17039, 323, 52335, 11059, 13, 4354, 11, 3330, 518, 279, 2606, 3897, 6788, 11, 358, 1744, 279, 6028, 6174, 525, 1447, 12, 3070, 34, 320, 56715, 652, 17039, 8, 1019, 12, 3070, 51, 320, 1001, 1222, 82, 16731, 299, 22838, 8776, 32295, 271, 3983, 3783, 11, 279, 2856, 2033, 5230, 356, 11, 386, 11, 350, 13, 6771, 752, 1990, 15934, 429, 382, 14190, 11, 304, 279, 2856, 3381, 1882, 11, 358, 6509, 429, 279, 5899, 17601, 2615, 2524, 323, 74059, 13, 2055, 11, 33611, 17039, 374, 8491, 9760, 1576, 315, 279, 16558, 323, 2615, 13, 32559, 25069, 2578, 387, 264, 14246, 4643, 1588, 11, 714, 432, 594, 2058, 949, 315, 279, 26829, 5899, 18414, 382, 4416, 11, 12831, 678, 419, 11, 279, 1429, 9760, 9183, 10943, 28360, 1035, 387, 3070, 34, 320, 56715, 652, 17039, 32295, 323, 3070, 51, 320, 1001, 1222, 82, 16731, 299, 22838, 8776, 32295, 13, 576, 6286, 315, 74059, 374, 803, 911, 279, 2213, 1660, 54215, 4751, 1091, 5961, 264, 5899, 5582, 624, 151649, 271, 73594, 2236, 198, 9640, 220, 330, 34, 756, 220, 330, 51, 698, 921, 73594]\n",

Several existing techniques are known in the open literature for this attack for 2G, 3G, and 4G LTE cellular technology. For example, some attacks target cell towers by overwhelming them with false status messages, while others introduce high levels of noise on signaling channels..

Email software has become increasingly sophisticated and feature-rich. In addition, email applications are ubiquitous and connected directly to the Web making them ideal targets to launch and propagate attacks. As the user demand for new functionality in email applications grows, they become more like browsers with complex rendering and plug in routines. As more email functionality is included and abstracted from the user, this creates opportunities for attackers. Virtually all email applications do not list email header information by default, however the email header contains valuable attacker vectors for the attacker to exploit particularly if the behavior of the email client application is known. Meta-characters are hidden from the user, but can contain scripts, enumerations, probes, and other attacks against the user's system.. The Domains of this are: Software, Software\n",

The description of this CAPEC is: An attacker exploits characteristics of the infrastructure of a network entity in order to perpetrate attacks or information gathering on network objects or effect a change in the ordinary information flow between network objects. Most often, this involves manipulation of the routing of network messages so, instead of arriving at their proper destination, they are directed towards an entity of the attackers' choosing, usually a server controlled by the attacker. The victim is often unaware that their messages are not being processed correctly. For example, a targeted client may believe they are connecting to their own bank but, in fact, be connecting to a Pharming site controlled by the attacker which then collects the user's login information in order to hijack the actual bank account..

The description of this CAPEC is: An attacker exploits characteristics of the infrastructure of a network entity in order to perpetrate attacks or information gathering on network objects or effect a change in the ordinary information flow between network objects. Most often, this involves manipulation of the routing of network messages so, instead of arriving at their proper destination, they are directed towards an entity of the attackers' choosing, usually a server controlled by the attacker. The victim is often unaware that their messages are not being processed correctly. For example, a targeted client may believe they are connecting to their own bank but, in fact, be connecting to a Pharming site controlled by the attacker which then collects the user's login information in order to hijack the actual bank account..

From these emanations, the attacker derives information about the data that is being processed (e.g. the attacker can recover cryptographic keys by monitoring emanations associated with cryptographic processing). This style of attack requires proximal access to the device, however attacks have been demonstrated at public conferences that work at distances of up to 10-15 feet.

Tracerouting can allow the adversary to construct a working topology of systems and routers by listing the systems through which data passes through on their way to the targeted machine. This attack can return varied results depending upon the type of traceroute that is performed. Traceroute works by sending packets to a target while incrementing the Time-to-Live field in the packet header. As the packet traverses each hop along its way to the destination, its TTL expires generating an ICMP diagnostic message that identifies where the packet expired. Traditional techniques for tracerouting involved the use of ICMP and UDP, but as more firewalls began to filter ingress ICMP, methods of traceroute using TCP were developed..

      "CAPEC Information for CAPEC ID CAPEC-117: A CAPEC with the title Interception. The description of this CAPEC is: An adversary monitors data streams to or from the target for information gathering purposes. This attack may be undertaken to solely gather sensitive information or to support a further attack against the target. This attack pattern can involve sniffing network traffic as well as other types of data streams (e.g. radio). The adversary can attempt to initiate the establishment of a data stream or passively observe the communications as they unfold. In all variants of this attack, the adversary is not the intended recipient of the data stream. In contrast to other means of gathering information (e.g., targeting data leaks), the adversary must actively position themself so as to observe explicit data channels (e.g. network traffic) and read the content. However, this attack differs from a Adversary-In-the-Middle (CAPEC-94) attack, as the adversary does not alter the content of the communications nor forward data to the intended recipient..

      "3GPP defines UP integrity protection algorithms in their specifications but many of the OEMs have not implemented them because of impact on the user experience (e.g. download and upload data throughputs). Enabling UP integrity protection requires considerable compute resources and adds overhead that directly impacts the maximum throughputs that can be measured on the user device. The integrity protection is enabled on the Control Plane messages but that still leaves the user’s data traffic vulnerable because the Control Plane and User Plane are segregated.

A malfunctioning or unavailable root of trust could potentially cause issues on the network and compromise RAN performance, privacy, etc. For example, the xApp could track a certain subscriber or impact service for a subscriber or a dedicated area. In addition, an xApp can receive order via A1 to control a certain UE and if a malfunctioning xApp receives an order to prioritize this UE, then the owner of the malfunctioning xApp knows a VIP that they want to track is in a certain area. With this command exposure, the attacker can obtain a rough location of a very important person and change the order from prioritize to deprioritize for a UE.\n",
      "Further, E2 interface exposes UE identification that can be exploited by a malicious xApp. As the E2 interface (similar to A1 interface) can point out a certain UE in the network, this will create a correlation between the randomized (anonymized) UE identities between the RAN nodes. For example, a xApp can potentially be used as a “sniffer” for UE identification. The additional challenge for the Near-RT RIC / E2 compared to the Non-RT RIC / A1 is that more frequent signaling is expected over the E2 interface to enable near-real-time operation.

The goal of this attack is to use a relatively few resources to create a large amount of traffic against a target server. To execute this attack, an adversary send a request to a 3rd party service, spoofing the source address to be that of the target server. The larger response that is generated by the 3rd party service is then sent to the target server. By sending a large number of initial requests, the adversary can generate a tremendous amount of traffic directed at the target.

The description of this CAPEC is: An adversary manipulates the content of request parameters for the purpose of undermining the security of the target. Some parameter encodings use text characters as separators. For example, parameters in a HTTP GET message are encoded as name-value pairs separated by an ampersand (&). If an attacker can supply text strings that are used to fill in these parameters, then they can inject special characters used in the encoding scheme to add or modify parameters. For example, if user input is fed directly into an HTTP GET request and the user provides the value \"myInput&new_param=myValue\", then the input parameter is set to myInput, but a new parameter (new_param) is also added with a value of myValue. This can significantly change the meaning of the query that is processed by the server.

Some implementations of ATA security will accept the ATA command to update the password without the user having authenticated with the BIOS. This occurs because the security mechanism assumes the user has first authenticated via the BIOS prior to sending commands to the drive. Various methods exist for exploiting this flaw, the most common being installing the ATA protected drive into a system lacking ATA security features (a.k.a. hot swapping).

Usually, this attack focuses on memory allocation, but any finite resource on the target could be the attacked, including bandwidth, processing cycles, or other resources. This attack does not attempt to force this allocation through a large number of requests (that would be Resource Depletion through Flooding) but instead uses one or a small number of requests that are carefully formatted to force the target to allocate excessive resources to service this request(s).

The description of this CAPEC is: An adversary exploits a weakness in ATA security on a drive to gain access to the information the drive contains without supplying the proper credentials. ATA Security is often employed to protect hard disk information from unauthorized access. The mechanism requires the user to type in a password before the BIOS is allowed access to drive contents. Some implementations of ATA security will accept the ATA command to update the password without the user having authenticated with the BIOS. This occurs because the security mechanism assumes the user has first authenticated via the BIOS prior to sending commands to the drive. Various methods exist for exploiting this flaw, the most common being installing the ATA protected drive into a system lacking ATA security features (a.k.a. hot swapping).

The description of this CAPEC is: An adversary exploits a weakness in ATA security on a drive to gain access to the information the drive contains without supplying the proper credentials. ATA Security is often employed to protect hard disk information from unauthorized access. The mechanism requires the user to type in a password before the BIOS is allowed access to drive contents. Some implementations of ATA security will accept the ATA command to update the password without the user having authenticated with the BIOS. This occurs because the security mechanism assumes the user has first authenticated via the BIOS prior to sending commands to the drive. Various methods exist for exploiting this flaw, the most common being installing the ATA protected drive into a system lacking ATA security features (a.k.a. hot swapping). Once the drive is installed into the new system the BIOS can be used to reset the drive password.. The Domains of this are: Supply Chain, Physical Security, Hardware\n",

Usually, this attack focuses on memory allocation, but any finite resource on the target could be the attacked, including bandwidth, processing cycles, or other resources. This attack does not attempt to force this allocation through a large number of requests (that would be Resource Depletion through Flooding) but instead uses one or a small number of requests that are carefully formatted to force the target to allocate excessive resources to service this request(s).

The description of this CAPEC is: An adversary consumes the resources of a target by rapidly engaging in a large number of interactions with the target. This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in rate limiting or flow. When successful this attack prevents legitimate users from accessing the service and can cause the target to crash. This attack differs from resource depletion through leaks or allocations in that the latter attacks do not rely on the volume of requests made to the target but instead focus on manipulation of the target's operations.

These attacks take advantage of the asymmetric relationship between the processing power used by the client and the processing power used by the server to create a secure connection. In this manner the attacker can make a large number of HTTPS requests on a low provisioned machine to tie up a disproportionately large number of resources on the server.

Usually, this attack focuses on memory allocation, but any finite resource on the target could be the attacked, including bandwidth, processing cycles, or other resources. This attack does not attempt to force this allocation through a large number of requests (that would be Resource Depletion through Flooding) but instead uses one or a small number of requests that are carefully formatted to force the target to allocate excessive resources to service this request(s).

If any of the intermediate nodes in this route are compromised by an attacker they could be used for a routing detour attack. From the compromised system the attacker is able to route the XML process to other nodes of their choice and modify the responses so that the normal chain of processing is unaware of the interception. This system can forward the message to an outside entity and hide the forwarding and processing from the legitimate processing systems by altering the header information..

The description of this CAPEC is: An attacker introduces malicious code to the victim's system by altering the payload of a software update, allowing for additional compromise or site disruption at the victim location. These manual, or user-assisted attacks, vary from requiring the user to download and run an executable, to as streamlined as tricking the user to click a URL. Attacks which aim at penetrating a specific network infrastructure often rely upon secondary attack methods to achieve the desired impact. Spamming, for example, is a common method employed as an secondary attack vector. Thus the attacker has in their arsenal a choice of initial attack vectors ranging from traditional SMTP/POP/IMAP spamming and its varieties, to web-application mechanisms which commonly implement both chat and rich HTML messaging within the user interface..

Usually, this attack focuses on memory allocation, but any finite resource on the target could be the attacked, including bandwidth, processing cycles, or other resources. This attack does not attempt to force this allocation through a large number of requests (that would be Resource Depletion through Flooding) but instead uses one or a small number of requests that are carefully formatted to force the target to allocate excessive resources to service this request(s).

The description of this CAPEC is: An attacker exploits characteristics of the infrastructure of a network entity in order to perpetrate attacks or information gathering on network objects or effect a change in the ordinary information flow between network objects. Most often, this involves manipulation of the routing of network messages so, instead of arriving at their proper destination, they are directed towards an entity of the attackers' choosing, usually a server controlled by the attacker. The victim is often unaware that their messages are not being processed correctly. For example, a targeted client may believe they are connecting to their own bank but, in fact, be connecting to a Pharming site controlled by the attacker which then collects the user's login information in order to hijack the actual bank account..

The description of this CAPEC is: In this attack scenario, the attacker passively monitors electromagnetic emanations that are produced by the targeted electronic device as an unintentional side-effect of its processing. From these emanations, the attacker derives information about the data that is being processed (e.g. the attacker can recover cryptographic keys by monitoring emanations associated with cryptographic processing). This style of attack requires proximal access to the device, however attacks have been demonstrated at public conferences that work at distances of up to 10-15 feet. There have not been any significant studies to determine the maximum practical distance for such attacks. Since the attack is passive, it is nearly impossible to detect and the targeted device will continue to operate as normal after a successful attack..

The description of this CAPEC is: An attacker hosts or joins an event or transaction within an application framework in order to change the content of messages or items that are being exchanged. Performing this attack allows the attacker to manipulate content in such a way as to produce messages or content that look authentic but may contain deceptive links, substitute one item or another, spoof an existing item and conduct a false exchange, or otherwise change the amounts or identity of what is being exchanged. The techniques require use of specialized software that allow the attacker to man-in-the-middle communications between the web browser and the remote system in order to change the content of various application elements. Often, items exchanged in game can be monetized via sales for coin, virtual dollars, etc. The purpose of the attack is for the attack to scam the victim by trapping the data packets involved the exchange and altering the integrity of the transfer process..

However, any content can be spoofed, including the content of email messages, file transfers, or the content of other network communication protocols. Content can be modified at the source (e.g. modifying the source file for a web page) or in transit (e.g. intercepting and modifying a message between the sender and recipient). Usually, the adversary will attempt to hide the fact that the content has been modified, but in some cases, such as with web site defacement, this is not necessary.

An adversary would try to exploit common filtering problems related to the use of the slashes characters to gain access to resources on the target host. Directory-driven systems, such as file systems and databases, typically use the slash character to indicate traversal between directories or other container components. For murky historical reasons, PCs (and, as a result, Microsoft OSs) choose to use a backslash, whereas the UNIX world typically makes use of the forward slash. The schizophrenic result is that many MS-based systems are required to understand both forms of the slash. This gives the adversary many opportunities to discover and abuse a number of common filtering problems.

An adversary would try to exploit common filtering problems related to the use of the slashes characters to gain access to resources on the target host. Directory-driven systems, such as file systems and databases, typically use the slash character to indicate traversal between directories or other container components. For murky historical reasons, PCs (and, as a result, Microsoft OSs) choose to use a backslash, whereas the UNIX world typically makes use of the forward slash. The schizophrenic result is that many MS-based systems are required to understand both forms of the slash.

The description of this CAPEC is: An attacker exploits characteristics of the infrastructure of a network entity in order to perpetrate attacks or information gathering on network objects or effect a change in the ordinary information flow between network objects. Most often, this involves manipulation of the routing of network messages so, instead of arriving at their proper destination, they are directed towards an entity of the attackers' choosing, usually a server controlled by the attacker. The victim is often unaware that their messages are not being processed correctly. For example, a targeted client may believe they are connecting to their own bank but, in fact, be connecting to a Pharming site controlled by the attacker which then collects the user's login information in order to hijack the actual bank account..

If an attacker can supply text strings that are used to fill in these parameters, then they can inject special characters used in the encoding scheme to add or modify parameters. For example, if user input is fed directly into an HTTP GET request and the user provides the value \"myInput&new_param=myValue\", then the input parameter is set to myInput, but a new parameter (new_param) is also added with a value of myValue. This can significantly change the meaning of the query that is processed by the server.

The description of this CAPEC is: The adversary extracts credentials used for code signing from a production environment and then uses these credentials to sign malicious content with the developer's key. Many developers use signing keys to sign code or hashes of code. When users or applications verify the signatures are accurate they are led to believe that the code came from the owner of the signing key and that the code has not been modified since the signature was applied. If the adversary has extracted the signing credentials then they can use those credentials to sign their own code bundles. Users or tools that verify the signatures attached to the code will likely assume the code came from the legitimate developer and install or run the code, effectively allowing the adversary to execute arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

The description of this CAPEC is: An adversary consumes the resources of a target by rapidly engaging in a large number of interactions with the target. This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in rate limiting or flow. When successful this attack prevents legitimate users from accessing the service and can cause the target to crash. This attack differs from resource depletion through leaks or allocations in that the latter attacks do not rely on the volume of requests made to the target but instead focus on manipulation of the target's operations. The key factor in a flooding attack is the number of requests the adversary can make in a given period of time.

Additionally, firewalls often open a port for each UDP connection destined for a service with an open UDP port, meaning the firewalls in essence save the connection state thus the high packet nature of a UDP flood can also overwhelm resources allocated to the firewall. UDP attacks can also target services like DNS or VoIP which utilize these protocols. Additionally, due to the session-less nature of the UDP protocol, the source of a packet is easily spoofed making it difficult to find the source of the attack..

Usually, this attack focuses on memory allocation, but any finite resource on the target could be the attacked, including bandwidth, processing cycles, or other resources. This attack does not attempt to force this allocation through a large number of requests (that would be Resource Depletion through Flooding) but instead uses one or a small number of requests that are carefully formatted to force the target to allocate excessive resources to service this request(s).

These attacks take advantage of the asymmetric relationship between the processing power used by the client and the processing power used by the server to create a secure connection. In this manner the attacker can make a large number of HTTPS requests on a low provisioned machine to tie up a disproportionately large number of resources on the server.

The description of this CAPEC is: An adversary may execute a flooding attack using the SSL protocol with the intent to deny legitimate users access to a service by consuming all the available resources on the server side. These attacks take advantage of the asymmetric relationship between the processing power used by the client and the processing power used by the server to create a secure connection. In this manner the attacker can make a large number of HTTPS requests on a low provisioned machine to tie up a disproportionately large number of resources on the server. The clients then continue to keep renegotiating the SSL connection. When multiplied by a large number of attacking machines, this attack can result in a crash or loss of service to legitimate users..

The description of this CAPEC is: An adversary exploits a resource shared between multiple applications, an application pool or hardware pin multiplexing to affect behavior. Resources may be shared between multiple applications or between multiple threads of a single application. Resource sharing is usually accomplished through mutual access to a single memory location or multiplexed hardware pins. If an adversary can manipulate this shared resource (usually by co-opting one of the applications or threads) the other applications or threads using the shared resource will often continue to trust the validity of the compromised shared resource and use it in their calculations. This can result in invalid trust assumptions, corruption of additional data through the normal operations of the other users of the shared resource, or even cause a crash or compromise of the sharing applications..

To realize DoS attacks, malicious users (MUs) target the critical functionalities for CR ecosystems, including spectrum sensing, agile radio, and light-handed regulation since once these functionalities fail, SUs are not able to communicate effectively. For example, MUs can directly jam the victim by injecting interference or deceive SUs into believing that there is a PU by emulating the signal characteristics of the PU, thereby evacuating the occupied spectrum. Moreover, the liability rule is vulnerable to the selfish and greedy users aiming to maximize their own private benefits.

Email software has become increasingly sophisticated and feature-rich. In addition, email applications are ubiquitous and connected directly to the Web making them ideal targets to launch and propagate attacks. As the user demand for new functionality in email applications grows, they become more like browsers with complex rendering and plug in routines. As more email functionality is included and abstracted from the user, this creates opportunities for attackers. Virtually all email applications do not list email header information by default, however the email header contains valuable attacker vectors for the attacker to exploit particularly if the behavior of the email client application is known.

      "Okay, the user asked \"What is AI?\" which seems pretty straightforward. But I should think about why they're asking this. Maybe they just heard the term and want a basic understanding, or perhaps they're curious about how it works beyond the surface level.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to define AI clearly but not too technically. They might be someone new to the topic, like a student or a person encountering AI in daily life through tools like chatbots. It's important to explain that AI isn't just one thing—it includes different approaches and goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should start with the simple definition: artificial intelligence is making machines smart. Then break it down into categories like narrow vs general AI. That helps differentiate current tech from sci-fi concepts. Examples would make it relatable, so mentioning things like Siri or self-driving cars could help them connect theory to practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, they might also be interested in how AI works under the hood. Should I explain machine learning? Yeah, because most modern AI uses ML, but not all. Maybe mention that some systems use rule-based programming too. But keep it simple—maybe just say \"AI can mean different things\" and then list supervised/unsupervised learning briefly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, considering their possible deeper needs: they might want to know if AI is trustworthy or what ethical concerns are. Or maybe they're looking for career opportunities in AI. I should touch on the goals of AI without getting into jargon—automation, problem-solving, decision-making. That gives a broader context.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure my answer isn't too long but covers enough ground. Start with basics, then elaborate on types and examples. Highlighting that AI is already around them could spark interest or reassure them it's not just theoretical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Check if there are any common misconceptions to address. For instance, people might think AI means robots taking over, so clarifying the difference between narrow AI and AGI here would help. Also, mentioning machine learning as a subset but integral part of modern AI avoids confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, wrap up with why it's important now—automation in various fields, decision-making tools. That ties back to their potential interest in relevance or applications. Keep the tone friendly and informative without overwhelming them.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "Okay, let's break down Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n",
      "\n",
      "**At its simplest:** AI is the idea of making machines \"smart\" – capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## More formally:\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence refers to the **theory and development** of computer systems or robots that exhibit traits like:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Learning:** The ability to learn from experience (data, user interactions).\n",
      "2.  **Problem Solving:** Finding solutions to complex issues.\n",
      "3.  **Perception:** Interpreting sensory information (like images or sounds).\n",
      "4.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understanding and generating human language.\n",
      "5.  **Reasoning & Decision Making:** Using logic to draw conclusions or make choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Concepts\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Machine Learning (ML):** This is a *subset* of AI where systems learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. It's the most common approach today and forms the basis for many AI applications.\n",
      "    *   Think: Training an image classifier on thousands of cat and dog photos so it can later recognize cats in new pictures.\n",
      "*   **Deep Learning:** A further subset of ML using artificial neural networks (inspired by the human brain) with multiple layers to analyze complex data, like images or language. It's responsible for breakthroughs in areas like computer vision and natural language processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Types of AI\n",
      "\n",
      "AI isn't just one thing; it encompasses different approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Narrow AI / Weak AI:** This is the type we interact with most often (like Siri, Alexa, Google Search). These systems are designed to perform a limited set of tasks in a specific domain (e.g., recognizing faces, translating text, playing chess). They don't possess general intelligence.\n",
      "2.  **General AI / Strong AI:** (This is more theoretical and the goal for many researchers) This would be an AI system with human-like cognitive abilities – understanding context, learning new things across different domains, reasoning about anything, like a human. We don't have this yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Goals of AI\n",
      "\n",
      "The ultimate aim of much AI research is to create systems that can:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Automate complex tasks.\n",
      "*   Solve problems previously thought to require human insight or creativity.\n",
      "*   Make decisions based on vast amounts of data and context.\n",
      "*   Interact with humans in a natural, intelligent way.\n",
      "\n",
      "## In short\n",
      "\n",
      "AI is the broad field focused on creating computer programs and systems that can perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. The most prominent technique today involves **machine learning**, where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being directly programmed for every instance.\n"
