Physical locks may range from traditional lock and key mechanisms, cable locks used to secure laptops or servers, locks on server cases, or other such devices. Techniques such as lock bumping, lock forcing via snap guns, or lock picking can be employed to bypass those locks and gain access to the facilities or devices they protect, although stealth, evidence of tampering, and the integrity of the lock following an attack, are considerations that may determine the method employed.

       "      <td>A CAPEC with the title Escaping Virtualization. The description of this CAPEC is:An adversary gains access to an application, service, or device with the privileges of an authorized or privileged user by escaping the confines of a virtualized environment. The adversary is then able to access resources or execute unauthorized code within the host environment, generally with the privileges of the user running the virtualized process. Successfully executing an attack of this type is often the first step in executing more complex attacks.. The Domain of this is: Software</td>\n",

       "52  A Threat with the title VM/Container escape attack and the descriptionVNF/CNF deployed on the same physical machine as tenants share the same host kernel and host OS resources. Lack of strong isolation between the VMs/Containers and the host allows for a potential risk of a rogue VM/Container escaping the VM/Container confinement and impacting other co-hosted VMs/Containers. In others, an attacker may deploy a new malicious VM/Container configured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing defenses within O-Cloud infrastructure.\\nAttacker deploys malicious VM/Container to escapes the host (Hypervisor/Container Engine/Host OS) and reaches the server’s hardware, then the malicious VM/Container can gain root access to the whole server where it resides. This gives the malicious VM/Container full control on all the VMs/Containers hosted on the same hacked server. This could allow an attacker to undermine the confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of VNFs/CNFs resources.\\nContainers can be deployed by various means, such as via Docker's create and start APIs or via a web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard or Kubeflow. Adversaries may deploy containers based on retrieved or built malicious images or from benign images that download and execute malicious payloads at runtime.\\nWhen a malicious VM/Container escapes isolation, it can gain full control over the underlying host and cause any of the below serious threats:\\n• Attacker would gain the ability to mount attacks on the host or compromise the host functionalities\\n• Compromise the confidentiality & integrity of co-hosted VMs/Containers and tenants\\n• Launch DDOS attacks on co-hosted VMs/Containers and host services thereby degrading their performance \\n• Introduce new vulnerabilities in host to be used for future attacks\\n• Lack of network segmentation could potentially expose other VMs/Containers in the environment to attack.

       "52  A Threat with the title VM/Container escape attack and the descriptionVNF/CNF deployed on the same physical machine as tenants share the same host kernel and host OS resources. Lack of strong isolation between the VMs/Containers and the host allows for a potential risk of a rogue VM/Container escaping the VM/Container confinement and impacting other co-hosted VMs/Containers. In others, an attacker may deploy a new malicious VM/Container configured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing defenses within O-Cloud infrastructure.\\nAttacker deploys malicious VM/Container to escapes the host (Hypervisor/Container Engine/Host OS) and reaches the server’s hardware, then the malicious VM/Container can gain root access to the whole server where it resides. This gives the malicious VM/Container full control on all the VMs/Containers hosted on the same hacked server. This could allow an attacker to undermine the confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of VNFs/CNFs resources.\\nContainers can be deployed by various means, such as via Docker's create and start APIs or via a web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard or Kubeflow. Adversaries may deploy containers based on retrieved or built malicious images or from benign images that download and execute malicious payloads at runtime.\\nWhen a malicious VM/Container escapes isolation, it can gain full control over the underlying host and cause any of the below serious threats:\\n• Attacker would gain the ability to mount attacks on the host or compromise the host functionalities\\n• Compromise the confidentiality & integrity of co-hosted VMs/Containers and tenants\\n• Launch DDOS attacks on co-hosted VMs/Containers and host services thereby degrading their performance \\n• Introduce new vulnerabilities in host to be used for future attacks\\n• Lack of network segmentation could potentially expose other VMs/Containers in the environment to attack. An example of this could be reconnaissance, exploitation and subsequent lateral movement to another host within the cluster.   \n",
