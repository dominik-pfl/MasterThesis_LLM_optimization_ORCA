       "1  An attacker uses techniques and methods to bypass physical security measures of a building or facility. Physical locks may range from traditional lock and key mechanisms, cable locks used to secure laptops or servers, locks on server cases, or other such devices. Techniques such as lock bumping, lock forcing via snap guns, or lock picking can be employed to bypass those locks and gain access to the facilities or devices they protect, although stealth, evidence of tampering, and the integrity of the lock following an attack, are considerations that may determine the method employed. Physical locks are limited by the complexity of the locking mechanism. While some locks may offer protections such as shock resistant foam to prevent bumping or lock forcing methods, many commonly employed locks offer no such countermeasures.   \n",

These interfaces may not be secured to industry best practices.\\nO-RAN components might be vulnerable if: \\n• Improper or missing authentication and authorization processes,\\n• Improper or missing ciphering and integrity checks of sensitive data exchanged over O-RAN interfaces,\\n• Improper or missing replay protection of sensitive data exchanged over O-RAN interfaces,\\n• Improper prevention of key reuse,\\n• Improper implementation,\\n• Improperly validate inputs, respond to error conditions in both the submitted data as well as out of sequence protocol steps.\\nAn attacker could, in such case, cause denial-of-service, data tampering or information disclosure, etc.\\nNOTE: O-RAN interfaces allow use of TLS or SSH. Industry best practices mandate the use of TLS (v1.2 or higher) or SSH certificate-based authentication. An implementation that implements TLS version lower than 1.2 or a SSH password authentication, may become the key source of vulnerability that a malicious code will exploit to compromise the O-RAN system.   \n",

O-RAN represents a paradigm shift in Radio Access Network (RAN) design, moving from proprietary hardware to a more open, virtualized, and software-driven approach. It is used for mobile communication networks, particularly for 5G and future generations. Key principles of O-RAN include:\n",
    "- Open System: Characterized by standardized, open interfaces to foster a multi-vendor ecosystem.\n",
    "- Disaggregated RAN: Functionalities are distributed across different physical or virtual network functions.\n",
