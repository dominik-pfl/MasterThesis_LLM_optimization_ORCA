            <xhtml:p>An adversary leverages a firmware weakness within the Thunderbolt protocol, on a computing device to manipulate Thunderbolt controller firmware in order to exploit vulnerabilities in the implementation of authorization and verification schemes within Thunderbolt protection mechanisms. Upon gaining physical access to a target device, the adversary conducts high-level firmware manipulation of the victim Thunderbolt controller SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) flash, through the use of a SPI Programing device and an external Thunderbolt device, typically as the target device is booting up. If successful, this allows the adversary to modify memory, subvert authentication mechanisms, spoof identities and content, and extract data and memory from the target device. Currently 7 major vulnerabilities exist within Thunderbolt protocol with 9 attack vectors as noted in the Execution Flow.</xhtml:p>

The description of this CAPEC is:An adversary adds malicious logic, often in the form of a computer virus, to otherwise benign software. This logic is often hidden from the user of the software and works behind the scenes to achieve negative impacts. Many times, the malicious logic is inserted into empty space between legitimate code, and is then called when the software is executed. This pattern of attack focuses on software already fielded and used in operation as opposed to software that is still under development and part of the supply chain.. The Domain of this is: Software

The description of this CAPEC is:An adversary manipulates the content of request parameters for the purpose of undermining the security of the target. Some parameter encodings use text characters as separators. For example, parameters in a HTTP GET message are encoded as name-value pairs separated by an ampersand (&). If an attacker can supply text strings that are used to fill in these parameters, then they can inject special characters used in the encoding scheme to add or modify parameters. For example, if user input is fed directly into an HTTP GET request and the user provides the value ""myInput&new_param=myValue"", then the input parameter is set to myInput, but a new parameter (new_param) is also added with a value of myValue. This can significantly change the meaning of the query that is processed by the server.

The description of this CAPEC is:An adversary is able to exploit features of the target that should be reserved for privileged users or administrators but are exposed to use by lower or non-privileged accounts. Access to sensitive information and functionality must be controlled to ensure that only authorized users are able to access these resources.. The Domains of this are: Software, Hardware
T-ORU-01;enterprise-attack;An attacker stands up a false base station attack by attacking an O-RU;CAPEC-617;0.5952038;"A Threat with the title An attacker stands up a false base station attack by attacking an O-RU and the descriptionA false base station attack occurs when an attacker masquerades as a legitimate mobile network to facilitate a Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attack between a subscriber’s user equipment (UE) and the mobile network. 
There are three attack scenarios on an O-RU that enable an attacker to realize a false base station attack: 
1. Hijack fronthaul to realize a false base station attack: Attacker disables an operational O-RU’s access to the open fronthaul, plugs a false base station system into the operational O-RU’s fronthaul interface, and launches a false base station attack with the O-RU providing the air interface.
2. Recruit a standalone O-RU to realize a false base station attack: The stand-alone O-RU is an O-RU that is not operational but is available to an attacker to incorporate into a false base station system. The attacker plugs a false base station system into the standalone O-RU’s fronthaul interface and launches a false base station attack with the O-RU providing the air interface.
3. Gain unauthorized physical access to O-RU to realize a false base station attack: An attacker gains access to external and internal components of an O-RU (other than the open fronthaul interface), connects the O-RU under attack to a false base station system, and launches a false base station attack with the O-RU providing the air interface.
Successful attacks may cause:
a) For a subscriber’s UE in attack scenarios 1, 2, and 3: the false base stations, also known as SUPI/5G-GUTI catchers, retrieves a subscriber identity by forcing a UE to attach to the false base station systems. This opens the door to subscriber identity interception/disclosure and unauthorized subscriber tracking attacks. These attacks include stealing subscriber information, tampering with transmitted information, tracking subscribers, and compromising subscriber privacy.
b) For the operator network: in attack scenario 1, the attacker removes the operational O-RU from providing service to UEs in the coverage area served by the operational O-RU.
c) For operators and vendors in attack scenarios 1, 2, and 3, the attacker recruits legitimate operator/vendor equipment for the purpose of creating a false base station attack on subscribers, possibly harming the reputation of the operator and vendor whose O-RU was used in the attack.
NOTE: The false base station threat has existed since GSM networks and continued to evolve and persist with the evolution of mobile networks. 5G networks are expected to introduce several security enhancements over 4G and legacy networks. Despite these security enhancements, 5G networks could still be a target of false base station attacks [19].";"A Threat with the title An attacker stands up a false base station attack by attacking an O-RU and the descriptionA false base station attack occurs when an attacker masquerades as a legitimate mobile network to facilitate a Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attack between a subscriber’s user equipment (UE) and the mobile network.

The description of this CAPEC is:In this attack scenario, the attacker imitates a cellular base station with their own ""rogue"" base station equipment. Since cellular devices connect to whatever station has the strongest signal, the attacker can easily convince a targeted cellular device (e.g. the retransmission device) to talk to the rogue base station..
