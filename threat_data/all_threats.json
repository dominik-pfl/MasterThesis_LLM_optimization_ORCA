Recruit a standalone O-RU to realize a false base station attack: The stand-alone O-RU is an O-RU that is not operational but is available to an attacker to incorporate into a false base station system. The attacker plugs a false base station system into the standalone O-RU\u2019s fronthaul interface and launches a false base station attack with the O-RU providing the air interface.\n3. Gain unauthorized physical access to O-RU to realize a false base station attack: An attacker gains access to external and internal components of an O-RU (other than the open fronthaul interface), connects the O-RU under attack to a false base station system, and launches a false base station attack with the O-RU providing the air interface.\nSuccessful attacks may cause:\na) For a subscriber\u2019s UE in attack scenarios 1, 2, and 3: the false base stations, also known as SUPI\/5G-GUTI catchers, retrieves a subscriber identity by forcing a UE to attach to the false base station systems. This opens the door to subscriber identity interception\/disclosure and unauthorized subscriber tracking attacks. These attacks include stealing subscriber information, tampering with transmitted information, tracking subscribers, and compromising subscriber privacy.\nb) For the operator network: in attack scenario 1, the attacker removes the operational O-RU from providing service to UEs in the coverage area served by the operational O-RU.\nc) For operators and vendors in attack scenarios 1, 2, and 3, the attacker recruits legitimate operator\/vendor equipment for the purpose of creating a false base station attack on subscribers, possibly harming the reputation of the operator and vendor whose O-RU was used in the attack.\nNOTE: The false base station threat has existed since GSM networks and continued to evolve and persist with the evolution of mobile networks. 5G networks are expected to introduce several security enhancements over 4G and legacy networks. Despite these security enhancements, 5G networks could still be a target of false base station attacks [19].",

    "Threat Description":"xApps in the Near-RT-RIC have the capability to manipulate behavior of a certain cell, a group of UEs, and a specific UE. A malfunctioning or unavailable root of trust could potentially cause issues on the network and compromise RAN performance, privacy, etc. For example, the xApp could track a certain subscriber or impact service for a subscriber or a dedicated area. In addition, an xApp can receive order via A1 to control a certain UE and if a malfunctioning xApp receives an order to prioritize this UE, then the owner of the malfunctioning xApp knows a VIP that they want to track is in a certain area. With this command exposure, the attacker can obtain a rough location of a very important person and change the order from prioritize to deprioritize for a UE.\nFurther, E2 interface exposes UE identification that can be exploited by a malicious xApp. As the E2 interface (similar to A1 interface) can point out a certain UE in the network, this will create a correlation between the randomized (anonymized) UE identities between the RAN nodes. For example, a xApp can potentially be used as a \u201csniffer\u201d for UE identification. The additional challenge for the Near-RT RIC \/ E2 compared to the Non-RT RIC \/ A1 is that more frequent signaling is expected over the E2 interface to enable near-real-time operation. Therefore, the UE identifier will be exchanged more frequently over the E2 than over the A1.",

Control Plane Attacks: These attacks target the module that is responsible for handling the migration process on a server which is called the migration module that is found in the host. By exploiting a bug in the migration module software, the attacker can hack the server and take full control over the migration module. This gives the attacker the ability to launch malicious activities including the following: \na. Migration Flooding: The attacker moves all the VMs\/Containers that are hosted on the hacked server to a victim server that does not have enough resource capacity to host all the moved VMs\/Containers. This causes a denial of service for the VNFs\/CNFs running in the VMs\/Containers of the victim server as there will not be enough resources to satisfy the demands of all the hosted VMs\/Containers leading into VM\/Container performance degradation and VM\/Container crashes.\nb. False Resource Advertising: The hacked server claims that it has a large resource slack (a large amount of free resources). This attracts other servers to off-load some of their VMs\/Containers to the hacked server so that the O-Cloud workload gets distributed over the O-Cloud servers. After moving VMs\/Containers from other servers to the hacked server, the attacker can exploit other vulnerabilities to break into the offloaded VMs\/Containers as now these VMs\/Containers are placed on a server that is under the control of the attacker.\n2. Data Plane Attacks: These constitute the second type of VM\/Container migration attacks and those attacks target the network links over which the VM\/Container is moved from a server to another. Such data plane attacks include the MitM where an attacker sniffs the packets that are exchanged between the source and destination servers and reads the migrated memory pages.

    "Threat title":"O-Cloud ID mismanagement",
    "Threat Description":"IDs are crucial for uniquely identifying objects within the O-Cloud. Mismanagement occurs when these IDs are not properly assigned, tracked, or validated, leading to potential overlaps or inconsistencies.\nPotential consequences:\n\u2022 ID Collision: Due to system glitches or bugs, two distinct objects could inadvertently be allocated the same ID. Such an occurrence is termed an ID collision. This can result in operations meant for one object inadvertently affecting the other.\n\u2022 Resource Overwrite: If two objects share the same ID, updates or modifications intended for one might overwrite the data of the other, leading to data inconsistencies or loss.\n\u2022 ID-Based Permissions: Many security protocols and access controls in O-Cloud can be tied to object IDs. If an attacker can predict, guess, or manipulate the ID generation process, they might gain unauthorized access to resources.\n\u2022 Log Merging: Monitoring tools and logging systems use IDs to track events and operations related to specific objects. If two objects share an ID, their logs might get merged, making it challenging to trace events back to their source.\n\u2022 RBAC Anomalies: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) regulations attached to specific object IDs could unintentionally approve or restrict access to the novel object due to misidentification.",

    "Threat Description":"Cognitive radio (CR) technology, which is designed to enhance spectrum utilization, depends on the success of opportunistic access, where unlicensed secondary users (SUs) exploit spectrum void unoccupied by primary users (PUs) for transmissions. To realize DoS attacks, malicious users (MUs) target the critical functionalities for CR ecosystems, including spectrum sensing, agile radio, and light-handed regulation since once these functionalities fail, SUs are not able to communicate effectively. For example, MUs can directly jam the victim by injecting interference or deceive SUs into believing that there is a PU by emulating the signal characteristics of the PU, thereby evacuating the occupied spectrum. Moreover, the liability rule is vulnerable to the selfish and greedy users aiming to maximize their own private benefits. Since complying with the rule results in less transmission opportunities, such SUs may not want to invest efforts to follow the rule and thus will transmit simultaneously with Pus.",

Hence, the ML model will no longer be a reliable one since it was trained on bad data and therefore modelling, decisions, predictions, model classifications, detections, etc. will surely not be appropriate. \nAlso, another scenario can be in a situation where a model is online and continues to learn during operational use, modifying its behavior over time.
